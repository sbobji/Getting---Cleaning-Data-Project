R script called run_analysis.R was created that does the following tasks:

1)Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2)Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3)Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4)Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The tidy data set is uploaded as attachment with a .txt file extension .

Please refer to the CodeBook.md file for the variables, methodology and the transformations details.
